### Building and running your application

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8085.

To more seed the database with some data make sure to run the `init.sh` script in `free_enterprise_db/db`. check the readme in `free_enterprise_db` for more information about requirements for that setup.
